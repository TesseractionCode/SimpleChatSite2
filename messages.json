I mean that's always been my assumption"},{"index":10,"username":"Daisy","message_text":"what do you mean \"just like us\"?"},{"index":11,"username":"Yao","message_text":"I mean I just want to know if dragons are the same as humans from a social standpoint. To me it kinda seems like it"},{"index":12,"username":"Daisy","message_text":"I guess if that's what you're here for, I can answer that for you. Yeah, we're the same. We just look different, maybe use different body language because we have... well... different bodies"},{"index":13,"username":"Yao","message_text":"Um, kinda off topic, but"},{"index":14,"username":"Yao","message_text":"do you think we could meet at some point?"},{"index":15,"username":"Daisy","message_text":"wdym meet?"},{"index":16,"username":"Yao","message_text":"like hang out or something.

Like fire breath, water breath, anything like that?"},{"index":30,"username":"Daisy","message_text":"ah no, that stuff isn't actually that real. I mean some dragons have it, but it's kinda lame imo. They're more like short bursts. I don't have anything like that, but I can sense levels of stress in other living things when I touch them. So maybe that's cool, I guess"},{"index":31,"username":"Yao","message_text":"that's amazing. It works on animals too?
